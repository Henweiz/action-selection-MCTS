# Action-Selection-MCTS in JAX for Single player games

This is a project for the course: Intelligent Decision Making Project (CS4210-B) 

This project dives into the different regularization terms for the action selection rules used in MCTS. 
For our research, we compared the results of the default MuZero, Variational KL and Expectation Propagation KL action selection rules. The plots can be found in the results folder or in our paper. 

To run our project properly, you can use the create_notebook.py to generate a Jupyter Notebook of our current project setup. 
Then you can adjust the params to the ones mentioned in our paper or your preferred values.
